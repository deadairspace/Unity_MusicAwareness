<h2>Awareness of one’s surroundings is an extremely important tool for video gamers when they try to tackle the challenges of
virtual environments. Video games typically allow the user to interact with a physical environment, but when game environments
become very large, they often require some sort of map to navigate. Traditionally these maps are visual representations of the game
environment, using visual cues to indicate important items like the location of the player’s goal. We would like to design a
map which uses audio cues, instead of visual cues, to help players recognize what’s around them, and where they are in the
game environment</h2>
